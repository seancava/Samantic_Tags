    <h1>Some History</h1>

      <h1>In the Beginning</h1>
      <p>I was born in a small town in Northern Ontario. My parents didn't have much but we made do and were happy. 
      When my parents finished school my father landed his first job with the Texeco Corporation. We moved South and continued on as a happy family.
      When I was 5 years old I started a long career in public school. Mostly the days were drudgery with occassional relief of socializing with my peers.
      Later when I entered highschool I was able to taylor my studies to suit my intrests. Fter Highschool I persued post secondary education at various achools studying
      various forms of visual art and design. After graduating with a diploma I set out to begin a career in graphic design.
      I worked here and there for some years before starting my own graphic design freelancing business.</p>

        <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
        <h2>I experienced a Christmas miracle!</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <p>During college I was employed at a local restaurant. Being the lowest in seniority I was given the only shift on Christmas day.
      <mark>I woke up that morning and was rather ticked</mark> that I had to work on the holiday. I dragged myself in and opened the restaurant.
      We had one customer that day...one customer! After the customer had finished eating he paid for his meal, he left. I walked over to
      clear the dishes from the customer's table and found an exceptionally large tip waiting for me.</p>
